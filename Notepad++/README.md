**Installation**

Copy `Knuddels_x64.dll` or `Knuddels_x86.dll` to your `plugins`-Directory from your Notepad++ installation.

**Build from source**

Make sure that you have added `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v8.0A\bin\NETFX 4.0 Tools` to your system `PATH`!

Before first build, change the Notepad++-Path on `Post-build` in the Project settings.
